## The rules

Keep it simple. Make it when you need it.<i class="nf nf-fa-info"></i>

- If it has a name, do not give it another name.
- If you have given it a name, do not give it another name.
- Start with one file until you need<i class="nf nf-fa-info"></i> another file.
- Start with one folder until you need<i class="nf nf-fa-info"></i> another folder.

Surrender or have a reason.<i class="nf nf-fa-info"></i>

- Adapt to the default configuration.
- After a sincere effort to adapt fails, change the default configuration.
- Do not think about lint and style. Use tools for that.

All the continuous things.<i class="nf nf-fa-info"></i>

- Test everything.<i class="nf nf-fa-info"></i>
- Deploy every merge request that passes the tests.
- Test everything.<i class="nf nf-fa-info"></i>
- Release main after every merge.

Source code hygiene.<i class="nf nf-fa-info"></i>

- Rebase to reorganize before you offer a pull request.
- Rebase again to squash before you merge to master.
