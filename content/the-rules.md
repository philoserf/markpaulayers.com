## The rules

Keep it simple. Make it when you need it.<sup>*</sup>

- If it has a name, do not give it another name.
- If you have given it a name, do not give it another name.
- Start with one file until you need<sup>*</sup> another file.
- Start with one folder until you need<sup>*</sup> another folder.

Surrender or have a reason.<sup>*</sup>

- Adapt to the default configuration.
- After a sincere effort to adapt fails, change the default configuration.
- Do not think about lint and style. Use tools for that.

All the continuous things.<sup>*</sup>

- Test everything<sup>*</sup>.
- Deploy every merge request that passes the tests.
- Test everything<sup>*</sup>.
- Release main after every merge.

Source code hygiene.<sup>*</sup>

- Rebase to reorganize before you offer a pull request.
- Rebase again to squash before you merge to master.

<sup>*</sup> add why | provide examples | define need | define everything
