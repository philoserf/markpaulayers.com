Baker v. Carr set aside the “political question doctrine”

Fourteenth Amendment (in its second section) explicitly acknowledged that states were entitled to deny equal voting rights

Hart Ely, who candidly justified Reynolds as a “non-interpretivist” (not merely “non-originalist”) exercise of judicial review warranted by the overarching objective of making American government more democratic in nature. Dubbed a “representation-reinforcing” theory of judicial review, and invoking the famous Footnote Four of the old (and otherwise inconsequential) Carolene Products case, Ely argued that the Supreme Court could retain legitimacy for rulings untethered to specific constitutional clauses as long as those rulings enhanced democratic procedures (while protecting “discrete and insular minorities” from the pathologies of majoritarian tyranny) and scrupulously refrained from imposing substantive policy choices not expressly necessitated by constitutional text.

Davis v. Bandamer, when in 1986 the Court first confronted a constitutional challenge to partisan gerrymandering

Vieth v. Jubilerer, when the issue came back before Court in 2004

Gill v. Whitford case that a districting map with an excessive “efficiency gap” violates Equal Protection.
