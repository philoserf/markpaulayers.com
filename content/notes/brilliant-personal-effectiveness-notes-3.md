You are what you think you are.

You are far more capable than you think you are (even if you think you are capable of a lot).

Change the conversation you have with yourself about yourself. Avoid ‘false scripts’.

Failure is a necessary prerequisite for success.

Things happen over which you have no control. Work on the things you can control.

Capabilities are not just based on past provable experiences but also on ‘future capabilities to be developed’.

We create a fulfilling future if we aren’t afraid of letting go of some of the past.

Have a go – there’s nothing to be lost and much to be gained.

To be a top performer you need to work very hard.

Excellence in you does not have an end point – talent might provide a slightly advantageous start point but does not predict the end point.

To be a top performer you have to want to work very hard. If you don’t want to work to get better you won’t.

Many top performers, although they describe the process of learning as being, in some ways, ‘painful’ also in hindsight talk of the enjoyment of the journey.

‘Future you’ is a great motivator as long as the future ‘you’ is the authentic ‘you’.

You ‘happen’ to a feedback conversation – don’t be a passive receiver of feedback.

Feedback is often (but certainly not always) given badly. Make it better by asking for specific performance-related examples.

Relate feedback to a specific experience and ask yourself how you would do it differently/better next time.

Ask for feedback. How do you know how you’re doing without it?

Feedback, whether praise or criticism, is valuable for learning and performance improvement. Always thank the giver.

Take time to consider how best to use feedback.

- Your effectiveness in the medium and long term will be a consequence of the level at which you engage in what you are doing.
- Be honest with yourself – how much control do you need over your job? How much are you willing to cede to others?
- Whatever you do, whenever you do it, find a reason for doing it.
- Find a good match between the treasures that lie within you and what you do when you work. Too much misalignment leads to unhappiness, ineffectiveness and perhaps even destructiveness.
- Be clear about the rewards you get from your work beyond financial remuneration
- Seek out learning opportunities that stretch you.
- Paying attention to the job is good, absorption in it is even better

- In any area of personal effectiveness you need to be clear what you are trying to achieve.
- This can take the form of a specific goal.
- You can maximise effectiveness by thinking through your strategy beforehand.
- You can maximise effectiveness by asking what your likelihood of success is.
- Use your experiences as learning opportunities.
- Don’t underestimate the effect others have on your own personal effectiveness.
- Setbacks and failure can be good if you respond in the right way.

ABCDE is a planning technique advocated by Brian Tracy in his book Eat That Frog as a way of planning at the beginning of the day. There are people who advocate planning your day just before you leave work the night before. Do what works best for you. Tracy tells us to divide all the tasks that need to be done in the following way.

- A Tasks – Must be done or there will be serious consequences.

- B Tasks – Should get done but if not the consequences will be milder than A tasks.

- C Tasks – Like to get done but no consequences if they don’t get done.

- D Tasks – I can delegate this. Pass on – through your manager if you can’t directly delegate – the things that others can do so that you do the things only you can do.

- E Tasks – I can eliminate this.

- Estimate the start and finish time for each task. Most of us think only about when we’re going to start.

- Beware ‘schedule creep’ – things that keep getting added to the list. Adding something? Then take something else off.

- It starts with a word – self-discipline.
- Do one thing at a time to completion – mono-task.
- Be creative in the way you create free time.
- Use ABCDE for planning and prioritising tasks.
- Email – choose when you use, don’t be an email slave.
- Time is a function of priority – be clear on what your priorities are at any given time.
- Disturbances are inevitable, the consequences are not.

- The energy you take from yourself needs to be replaced. Not doing so causes stress, burnout and ill health.
- Check in with your feelings so you detect the warning signs.
- The warning signs direct you to the need for renewal.
- Some people ‘hide’ in the survival zone without recognising the long-term damage being done.
- Great performance comes from the ability to truly connect with what you are doing and then to truly disconnect and renew yourself.
- Know your catalysts – the things you can easily access that relax you and give you pleasure.
- Enjoy ‘being in the moment’ and the simple pleasures that exist around you.

‘Congruence’ or synchronicity across body language, language (the words) and paralanguage (the way you say the words) facilitates understanding of what’s being said and the meaning behind it. Neuroscience research has shown that not only does our brain change our body but also the most recent research says the body can change the brain. ‘Power pose’ before situations when you need to make an impact. Look for ‘leakage’ – those micro-expressions that are the fleeting signs of what someone really thinks and feels. Maintain eye contact but don’t ‘outstare’. Avoid sudden eye movements away from the other person. Clusters of body and facial movements indicate what someone really thinks and feels – not one-off gestures. Mirroring/postural echo and matching with your body language help create rapport. Keep an open posture – in one-to-one situations and when speaking to a group.

---

Consider all the situations in which listening is important in your working life. Be aware of your own barriers to listening. Be a good, trusted person to talk to. Actively move yourself up the ‘creative listening scale’. Use the right language – verbal and non-verbal. Actively show attentiveness and accuracy through paraphrasing and empathy. Your world is not the only world. Be prepared to step into another’s world, i.e. show true empathy. Use insightful questions to move the conversation forward (see below).

---

Speaking effectively to groups is a brilliant career accelerator. The main purpose of any talk, speech or formal presentation to a group of people is that the group remembers your key message(s). Remember that a speaker is a communicator who understands that emotional connection means information retention: I + E = C. Use the VHF – visual, hearing and feeling – channels to create that emotional connection. You are your number one visual aid. Use assertive language that delivers your message in the way you want. Use tone, pause and passion for impact and to vary the way the message is delivered. Stories and anecdotes engage the group.

---

In conversation learn to adapt to the styles of others. Avoid generalisations – be specific. Avoid remarks about personality – keep to the facts. Avoid moaning yourself and keep clear of moaners. Use active words and phrases such as ‘can’ and ‘will’ rather than passive ones such as ‘perhaps’ and ‘possibly’. Ask ‘Am I being understood the way I want to be understood?’ Flattery is a good way to stop someone who has been talking for too long. Use the four ‘P’s in your voice – pitch, punch, pace/pause, passion.

---

Your goal statement should be run through the ‘head’ and ‘heart’ filters.

Use SMART to appeal to the rational side of goal-setting.

Use SPARC to ensure you are emotionally engaged.

Check in with yourself to help manage your behaviour when pursuing your goals.

Big goals should be broken down into stages or ‘timelines’.

Big goals are usually less motivating than the shorter-term pursuit of timelines.

What sort of person are you? Many people are happy living in the moment with few goals at all.

---

Brilliant questions lead to brilliant insights. Use open questions for information and understanding. Use the question funnel to achieve clarity. See questioning as a way of tuning in to another person’s thoughts and feelings. Good questions are essential for the core areas of effectiveness such as assertiveness and time management.

---

Assertive behaviour allows you to express your needs, meet them and preserve relationships. It is an essential skill for professional impact and effectiveness. Aggressive behaviour denies rights, uses force and manipulation and ruins relationships. Look out for the signs of aggressive behaviour in others and avoid using aggression yourself. Passive/non-assertive behaviour means being misunderstood or needs being ignored and therefore not met. Mentally rehearse assertive approaches using ‘sound inner dialogues’ – the self-talk that prepares for effective interactions between you and others. Use the three languages effectively. Don’t be manipulated – clarify your rights in your own mind. Seek ‘win-win’ where needs are met and relationships strengthened.

---

Building trust, being credible and building a good reputation give you influence. Influence doesn’t mean you ignore the wants and needs of others. Almost everyone asks the ‘WII FM’ question. Influencing features many of the core elements we associate with assertiveness (e.g. excellent communication skills, good mental rehearsal). Building on common ground creates a way forward. Consciously adopt the correct influencing strategy for the person and the situation (e.g. ‘coalition’ when you are individually weak). Adapt your approach for different organisational cultures.

leaders/coordinators – Direction drivers – Action creators – Ideas harmonisers – Relationships achievers – Results challengers – Restraint networkers – Resources.

---

Team members need to fullfil a number of key roles – technical and behavioural – that need to be performed. The seven key behavioural roles are: leader/coordinator, driver, creator, harmoniser, achiever, challenger, and networker. You will have at least one behavioural role type that comes more naturally to you than others – possibly up to three although in rare cases more. Use the strengths of the role type for the benefit of the team. Be aware that most role types also come with potential vulnerabilities that affect the team’s output.

---

Many organisations see the art of collaboration as a key competitive advantage. Collaboration means the output exceeds the collective contributions of individuals in the team – we take the combined thinking to another level of performance altogether. Collaboration solves problems and creates and exploits opportunities. Have a big goal but tackle it step-by-step. Avoid contaminating the collaborative process with an overactive ego. Nearly all problems have many solutions. Nearly all opportunities have many way in which they can be exploited. You have a wonderful capacity for idea generation – use routine, evolutionary and revolutionary thinking. Listen to and build on the thinking of others. Bring your whole self to the team – mind, body and spirit.

---

Happen to a meeting – don’t let it happen to you. Engage with the team. Be multilingual – speak language, paralanguage and body language. Exhibit good manners. Meetings provide excellent learning opportunities in relatively non-threatening environments.

---

Be aware of the particular challenges that remote and virtual team-working presents – isolation, communication difficulties and maintaining relationships are three common ones. Isolation can be self-inflicted – be proactive about connecting with the outside world. Don’t just connect ‘virtually’. Keep your knowledge of online platforms – internal and external – that can aid your effectiveness up-to-date. Don’t get left behind. Keep in touch with the team – sharing stories, feedback, setbacks and successes. Make the effort to meet for real if possible – it makes the virtual relationship so much stronger. Trust is the basis on which online relationships thrive – meet your commitments, be reliable.

---

Do actively look out for peers – not just people you have met but also online acquaintances, people you know of who may know of you and potential contacts who have been recommended to you.

Do

Send a message to new connections – those you invite and those who invite you. Offer help and support and explore areas of possible mutual interest. Give testimonials and you will see that this is reciprocated. Join specialist groups that cover subjects that you have an interest in. There are several excellent groups covering innovation for example and if you have management aspirations or you are a manager now then joining leadership and management discussion groups will be a valuable way of keeping up with management trends, research and to get some advice if needed. There are millions of people willing to share knowledge (and to hear your experiences as well). Don’t

Just use LinkedIn for your own purposes but also indicate how you can help others. Limit yourself to the narrow confines of your own industry or sector within it. Opportunities often come from unlikely sources so look to widen your network beyond the confines of your own world. Just talk about yourself – explore the worlds of your connections.

---

Many of the attributes we associate with the traditional networker apply to the ‘online’ social networker – effective communicator, proactive, open-minded, keeps in touch. Be a relationship builder not a people user. Manage your reputation online – be authentic, demonstrate your provable skills and value with examples. As a general rule keep the personal and professional separate. Share knowledge, industry and topic (e.g. leadership) trends, research and connections with others. Be open-minded about who you connect with and where opportunities come from.

---

Email is one form of communication among many – use it for the right reasons and not just because it is easy. The purpose – clearly defined – will determine who sees it and why. Ask ‘How is this email likely to be read? Is that what I want?’ Professional standards with email (e.g. spelling and grammar) should be no different to more traditional forms of written communication. Follow George Orwell’s rules for good writing – avoid jargon, clichés, hackneyed phrases, passive words and phrases, and intellectual arrogance. Keep it simple – can you say more with less?
